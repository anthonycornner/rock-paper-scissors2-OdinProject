*Create a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors, this function takes two params: "playerSelection" and "computerSelection" and RETURNS a string that declares the winner like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock!"
*Make sure the playerSelection func is case-insensitive so users can input any type of capitalization of the different selections
